//== Introduction

_SDEditGen_ is a preprocessor tool for __Quick Sequence Diagram Editor__,
better known as __sdedit__.
_QSDE / sdedit_ is an excellent open source _text to UML_ tool, but its
syntax is not
so nice: it is often unintutitive, cryptic, and hard to remember.
Also, like syntax of many sequence diagram tools, _sdedit's_ syntax is
__unstructured__. It is easy to create and read a _Hello world (Bob -> Alice)_
example, but it is much harder to write and read complex real-world diagrams.
_SDEditGen_ aims to provide a structured, nicer, easier and more
intuitive syntax for __sdedit__.

== QSDE / sdedit: good parts

=== Nice desktop GUI application

_Quick Sequence Diagram Editor_ is
a GUI application, with the open diagrams tree view on the left,
the text editor on the bottom right and the real-time diagram preview pane
on the top right:

=== Plenty of features

QSDE / sddit offers some features which are not very often found
in sequence diagram tools, like _real time diagram server_ and __mutithreading
support__, as well as not so exotic but nice features like 
__automatic redrawing__.

=== Links to other diagrams

In my view this is the *most important* feature for real-world complex
diagrams! For toy examples it is not needed, of course.

ifdef::env-github[]

<img align="left" role="right" src="images/links.png?raw=true"/>
++++
endif::[]

The diagram to the {leftOrRight} includes the links to diagrams _Create_Matadata.sd_
and _Create_leaf.sd_. When the user *clicks* on a _diagram link_ the
application will *replace* the current diagram with the clicked one,
and also display the newly opened diagram name in the tree view.

Why is this feature so important? The main reason why we need UML diagrams
at all is software **complexity**. Therefore the diagrams worth to
be drawn are also complex, and this means they tend to become **big**
pretty soon.
In my view a *single* diagram *should not* become too big.
Perhaps a meaningful limit for a single diagram is that it horizontally fits
a screen width in the full-screen mode and that vertically it is not much
bigger than what fits in the full screen. If we want to follow this tip
the only solution is to break a potentially big diagram into smaller
interlinked diagrams.

There are many _text to UML_ tools but it is questionable whether any
open source or inexpensive tool besides _sdedit_ includes
a similar functionality.

== What's wrong with sdedit

=== Unstructured syntax

An important use case for sequence diagrams is when we need to *understand*
an unfamiliar, complex and undocumented source code.

The source code written in modern programming languages is **structured**:
individual declarations and instructions
reside in *classes* and **methods**, they are not just floating around.

On the other hand, the code in _sdedit_ and many other _text to UML_
tools is **unstructured**: these tools don't provide the means to reflect
the structure present in the source code.

The basic syntax for sending messages in _sdedit_ is following:

[source,java]
----
<caller>:<callee>.message
----

These instructions are by far the most common ones, so our program is mostly
just a sequence of such instructions.

=== Do repeat yourself

Object-oriented programming languages don't force us to specify the current
object when we call methods of other objects. Unlike that, when we are writing
_sdedit_ code we must specify the current object each time. For example:

[cols=2*,separator=¦,frame=none,grid=none]
|===

a¦
[source,java]
----
manager:protocolBuilder.new
*1 manager
	link:Create_Metadata.sd
*1
manager:protocolBuilder.add(Metadata)
*2 manager
	link:Create_Leaf.sd
*2
manager:protocolBuilder.add(Leaf)
----

a¦
image::diagramLinks.png[DiagramLinks,align="left"]
|===

This affects readability badly.

=== Cryptic syntax

Let's illustrate the problematic syntax on just one example. 

In the following line it looks that the source object _bfs_ assigns the variable 
__adjList__, but actually this specifies that
the target object's method _getAdjacentNodes_ *returns* __adjList__, 
which is something quite different:

[source,]
----
bfs:adjList=node.getAdjacentNodes()
----

== SDEditGen: structured syntax for sdedit

=== Object creation & method calls

The most important operations supported by SDEditGen are object creation
and method calling.

*QSDE / sdedit* models both operations as message passing:

[source,scala]
----
sourceObject:targetObject.new(arguments)
sourceObject:targetObject.method(arguments)
----

The **SDEditGen**’s basic idea is to avoid specifying the source object in
every object creation and method call: the source object should be
determined implicitly. The SDEditGen's syntax for these operations is
simply:

[source,scala]
----
new targetObject(arguments)
call targetObject.method(arguments)
----

How can we achieve the source object to be implicitly known? There are
several ways, but let’s show the simplest way first.

==== Object as context

Let’s say the object _test_ creates the object _adapter_ and we don’t
care in which particular method this is happening.
We can specify it like this:

[cols=2*,separator=¦,frame=none,grid=none]
|===

a¦
[source,scala]
----
object test {
	new adapter
}
----

a¦
image::newAdapter.png[NewAdapter,align="left"]
|===

NOTE: The *object* statement implicitly provides the *context* (the
*source* object) for the enclosed operations.

If the object _test_ calls a method on the created object, we also don’t
have to specify the source object because it is known from the context:


[cols=2*,separator=¦,frame=none,grid=none]
|===

a¦
[source,scala]
----
object test { <1>
	new adapter
	call adapter.init
}
----
<1> The object _test_ is the source object for both enclosed operations.

a¦
image::newInit.png[NewInit,align="left"]
|===

==== Method call as context

So far so good, but how can we specify the context if __adapter__’s _init_
method creates another object?

We can do it easily because __adapter__’s _init_ method call itself can
serve as a context:

[cols=2*,separator=¦,frame=none,grid=none]
|===

a¦
[source,scala]
----
object test { <1>
	new adapter
	call adapter.init { <2>
		new manager
	}
}
----
<1> The object _test_ is the source object for both enclosed operations
(__new__ and __call__).
<2> The object _adapter_ is the source object for the enclosed operation
(__new__).

a¦
image::newInitManager.png[NewInitManager,align="left"]
|===

NOTE: The *method call* statement implicitly provides the *context* (the
*source* object) for the enclosed operations.

==== Object creation as context

What if the __manager__’s constructor creates yet another object?

You guess it:
the __manager__’s creation instruction can also implicitly determine the
source object for instructions (object creations and method calls) performed
in the constructor:

[cols=2*,separator=¦,frame=none,grid=none]
|===

a¦
[source,scala]
----
object test { <1>
	new adapter
	call adapter.init { <2>
		new manager { <3>
			new context
		}
	}
}
----
<1> The object _test_ is the source object for both enclosed operations
(__new__ and __call__).
<2> The object _adapter_ is the source object for the enclosed operation
(__new__).
<3> The object _manager_ is the source object for the enclosed operation
(__new__).

a¦
image::newInitManagerContext.png[NewInitManagerContext,align="left"]
|===

NOTE: The *object creation* statement implicitly provides the *context* (the
*source* object) for the enclosed operations.

=== Object declarations

Finally we are ready to show the complete example:

[cols=2*,separator=¦,frame=none,grid=none]
|===

a¦
[source,scala]
----
objects { <1>
    test: AdapterTest | named existing <2>
    adapter: Adapter
    manager: Manager
    context: Context
}

object test {
    new adapter
    call adapter.init {
        new manager {
            new context
        }
    }
    call manager.manage(arg1, arg2) {
        loop {
            call context.getItem
        }
    }
}
----
<1> The keyword _objects_ encloses the **object declarations**.
<2> The words _named_ and _existing_ are *flags* describing object attributes.
They corresponding to _sdedit_ flags.

=== Return clauses

Adding returned objects or values to diagrams can significantly improve 
readability. 
SDEditGen's syntax supports _return_ clauses in object creation and 
method call statements:

[source,scala]
----
new targetObject(arguments) return expression
call targetObject.method(arguments) return expression
----

In my view this syntax is considerably easier to read and understand
than the original _sdedit_ syntax.
The following diagram includes several _return_ clauses:

[source,scala]
----
object bfs {
    new queue
    call someNode.setLevel(0)
    call queue.insert(someNode)
    loop "while queue != ()" {
        call queue.remove() return node <1>
        call node.getLevel() return level
        call node.getAdjacentNodes() return adjList
        loop "0 <= i < #adjList" {
            call adjList.get(i) return adj
            call adj.getLevel() return nodeLevel
            alt "nodeLevel IS NOT defined" { <2>
                call adj.setLevel(`level+1`)
                call queue.insert(adj)
            section "else"
            }
        }
    }
    call queue.destroy()
}
----
<1> An example of a method returning an object
<2> The *alt* construct corresponds to _[c:alt]_ construct in _sdedit_

=== Diagram links

The following diagram contains several _diagramLink_ statements:

[source,scala]
----
objects {
    test: ProtocolAdapterTest | existing
    adapter: ProtocolAdapter
    configurator: ProtocolAdapterConfigurator
    confHelp: ConfigurationHelper
    manager: Manager
    protocolBuilder: ProtocolBuilder
    protocol: Protocol
}

object test {
    new adapter;
    call adapter.init(configuration) {
        new configurator(this, configuration) {
            new confHelp(this);
        }
        new manager(configurator) {
            new protocolBuilder;
			
            diagramLink "Create_Metadata.sd" 1; <1>
            call protocolBuilder.add(Metadata);
			
            diagramLink "Create_Leaf.sd" 2;
            call protocolBuilder.add(Leaf);

            loop { <2>
                call protocolBuilder.add(Hierarchy);
            }
            call protocolBuilder.add(Top);
            call protocolBuilder.add(Timestamp);
            call protocolBuilder.build {
                new protocol(this) {
                    call protocol "Copy items from builder"; <3>
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
----
<1> The *diagramLink* statement creates a link to another _sdedit_
diagram
<2> The *loop* construct corresponds to _[c:loop]_ construct 
in __sdedit__.
<3> A _method name_ doesn't have to be an __identifier__, it can be 
descriptive. The _dot_ character between object name and method name
is __optional__. A statement can end with a __semicolon__, but it is 
_optional_ as well.

=== Syntax diagrams

The SDEditGen syntax is described in the form of {railroadDiagrams}
generated by {rrdTool} tool. The following *excerpt* illustrates 
how they look:

image::syntaxExcerpt.png[SyntaxExcerpt,align="left"]

=== Running

SDEditGen currently doesn't include a graphical user interface. 
There are two ways of converting the source SDEDitGen code to 
sdedit format: an HTTP server and a command-line interface.

==== HTTP server

An HTTP server which converts from SDEDitGen to sdedit format allows 
us to use GUI of an HTTP client application like __Insomnia__.

The server can be started from command line using `sbt runMain` command: 

[source,scala]
----
sbt "runMain sdeditgen.Server"
----

Alternatively, you can first start _sbt_ and then execute __runMain__:

[source,scala]
----
$ sbt

> runMain sdeditgen.Server
----

The command starts the server on the port **8080**. To convert from SDEditGen 
source code to sdedit format just issue an HTTP *POST* request to the 
following endpoint:

[source,]
----
localhost:8080/generate
----

With _Insomnia_ it looks like this: 

image::insomnia.png[Insomnia,align="left"]

==== Command-line interface

An SDEditGen source file can be converted into sdedit form by the
following command:

[source,scala]
----
sbt "runMain sdeditgen.CLI <input file path> <output folder path>"
----

Both paths can be relative or absolute. If _<output folder path>_ is
a relative path it is interpreted as a subfolder of the input folder.
If _<output folder path>_ is a dot character the input and output folders
are the same.

The input file's extension must be __sdgen__. 

Let's see several examples:

[source,scala]
----
sbt "runMain sdeditgen.CLI /users/jsmith/source/demo.sdgen target"

sbt "runMain sdeditgen.CLI /users/jsmith/source/demo.sdgen /users/jsmith/source/target"

sbt "runMain sdeditgen.CLI source/demo.sdgen target"

sbt "runMain sdeditgen.CLI demo.sdgen ."
----

Of course, an alternative way is to start _sbt_ and execute __runMain__ 
in __sbt shell__:

[source,scala]
----
$ sbt

> runMain sdeditgen.CLI <input file path> <output folder path>
----
